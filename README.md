# Inventory Management System H.F
This project is a smart Inventory Management System that combines software development and hardware automation to improve efficiency in stock management. The system is based on a Java application connected to a central database, where all information about stored items is managed, including item name, quantity, and physical location inside a smart shelf (e.g., A1, A2, B1).  The physical part of the system consists of a smart shelf with multiple drawers, each assigned a unique coordinate. Using the application, authorized users can remotely open or close drawers via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, add or remove items, and update inventory data in real time. All changes are automatically synchronized with the database.  This project supports Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8) by helping businesses optimize their operations, reduce manual labor, and create opportunities for employment in IT, automation, and system maintenance. The system is designed to be scalable and can be adapted for warehouses, small businesses, and educational purposes.
